## Description

a task that allows the unification of two different types of providers to be able to store the same data from both of them using the same format 

## Very Important Notes

the task includes also the Nestjs Way of renaming properties using the @Expose decorator and validation is included as well in a clean way in the .serialization files which also includes the renaming and the logic of isIos or isAndroid and isDesktop, allowing for an overall clean Nest architecture
